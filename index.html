            <p>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
                But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                This year, to save me from tears<br>
                I'll give it to someone special</p>
            <p>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
                But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                This year, to save me from tears<br>
                I'll give it to someone special</p>
            <p>Once bitten and twice shy<br>
                I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
                Tell me baby, do you recognize me?<br>
                Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me</p>
            <p>Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
                With a note saying "I love you", I meant it<br>
                Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
                But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again</p>
            <p>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
                But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                This year, to save me from tears<br>
                I'll give it to someone special</p>

                But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                This year, to save me from tears<br>
                I'll give it to someone special</p>
            <p>Ooh<br>Oh, oh, baby</p>
            <p>A crowded room, friends with tired eyes<br>
                I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice<br>
                My God, I thought you were someone to rely on<br>
                Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on</p>
            <p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>
                A man under cover, but you tore me apart<br>
                Oh, oh now I've found a real love<br>
                You'll never fool me again</p>
            <p>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
                But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                This year, to save me from tears<br>
                I'll give it to someone special, special

            <p>Special</p>
            <p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you mine)<br>
                A man under cover but you tore him apart<br>
                Maybe next year I'll give it to someone<br>
                I'll give it to someone special</p>
            <p>Special<br>So long</p>
